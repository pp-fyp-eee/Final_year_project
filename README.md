# Final year project

All applications require the use of an Apple ID to install on-device. For testing purposes, open the projects within Xcode, select the project within the left side-panel and click on the ‘Signing and Capabilities’ tab. Here, an existing team can be selected, or a new team can be created by signing into an existing Apple ID. For help regarding this, please refer to [Apple’s Developer Documentation](#https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev60b6fbbc7).
